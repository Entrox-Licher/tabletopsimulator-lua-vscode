description: How does the extension resolve external files?
---

This extension, similar to the official Atom Plugin, allows developers to structure their scripts among several files, the way of doing so is with the following statements:

- `require("<FILE>")` for Lua
- `<Include src="<FILE>"/>` for XML

There's an ordered priority list from which these files will be looked up from, stopping at the first match:

1. Documents Folder: `~/Documents/Tabletop Simulator`
2. Folders described in `TTSLua.includeOtherFilesPaths` setting
3. Folders currently opened in the workspace

And specifically for Lua, the `TTSLua.searchBundlePattern` setting allows modification of the lookup pattern. The extension will look for files ending with `.lua` by default.

## Example
